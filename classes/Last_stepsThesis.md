# Steps towards a succesful defense day

These are the steps to follow after you have got the document: "Permission to proceed to public examination of doctoral dissertation". This is not an official guide, this is what I recomend doing based on my personal experience during August 2018, so please follow these steps with caution and always follow the advice from official written guidelines and responsible people. 

Good luck and be the thesis force be with you! @olalla



1. Send an email to karipekka.byman@luke.fi requestion an ISBN for yout hesis book and Disserationes number, attach in this email the pdf document: "Permission to proceed to public examination of doctoral dissertation"

2. Send the ISBN number,  Dissertationes thesis number, the photo, title, etc  for the cover of your thesis book to GRANO (the printing company) and ask them to prepare the cover proof for you, send this information to Johanna.taavitsainen@grano.fi. (Tell her also your defense date so they know how quickly they should do it). 

3. Get ready the text for the final version of your thesis summary (remember to prepare the two second pages: one for the printed version and another for the online version, find more information on that regard here: https://ojs.silvafennica.fi/index.php/dissertationes/about/submissions#authorGuidelines)

4. Send the final thesis summary text, the two versions of the second pages (online and printed) and cover proof that Grano has gave you to karipekka.byman@luke.fi (Disserationes editor), he will check that all the formating is correct. [IMPORTANT: You can do step 2 and 4 at the same time to save time! remember that you will have to send a second email to disserationes editor: karipekka.byman@luke.fi to accept the cover when you get it from GRANO]

5. Prepare the description form of your thesis for your online submission (NOTE! that you will need a finnish translation of your title, abstract and keywords, ask for help in advance if you anre not finnish native speaker). The form can be found here: http://www.dissertationesforestales.fi/instructions/document_description.rtf

6. Send the pdf text to GRANO to get the text pdf proof (the images quality migh be lower than the final version for file size issues).

7. Aprove both the cover pfd and text pdf from GRANO, tell them that they can proceed with the printed proof. They will send you in 2-3 days a printed version of your thesis, IMPORTANT: provide them in this email your correct office address or place where you want to get the printed proof! (some thesis book has been lost in campus for couple of days, which is not nice if you are tight with time! )

8. Check the printed proof and tell GRANO by email that you aprove them (by now you will probably be dealing with the gerenal printing email of GRANO, just reply to the emails from where you are getting the information)

9. Order the printed copies, this might take from 4 days to 1week in my experience, but if you enfasize that you are in a hurry they can speed the process (be insistent on that!).

10. Upload the online version of your thesis in here https://ojs.silvafennica.fi/index.php/dissertationes/about/submissions (right side see "make a submission"), if you have any problem creating your profile contact karipekka.byman@luke.fi, the online submission will be probably be online in the same day. You only upload the thesis summary here (no cover, no articles! and remember that the second page should be the online version), I will also recomend to upload a pdf version and not the word version.

11. Book an appointment with the academic rector (rector in Joensuu) (secretary: tarja.ryhanen@uef.fi) and dean of the faculty (secretary: satu.turunen@uef.fi, tell her that you want to give it in Joensuu campus! if you are located in Joensuu) to give them a printed copy of your thesis 

12. Go an take the photo for the media communication **Photo place-kk kuva** (0503014144), just book an appointment, you do not have to pay anything one photo is payed by the university. I recomend that you tell them to send a copy to your email, they will send the photo to the communication officer of the UEF too.

13. Fill the media communication form (all the info here: https://www.uef.fi/en/research/doctoralschool/media-coverage), fill the dissertation form https://teamplace.uef.fi/sites/forms/dissertations/Lists/List/NewForm.aspxsend. Send the media communication form and the photo you took in kk kuva to: marianne.mustonen@uef.fi

14. You will get 40 printed copies, you have to send as follow:

    1. 4 copies**➜ **Suomen Metsätieteellinen Seura: Send the 4 copies of your thesis divided into 2 envelopes to be sure they are delivered into our office instead of some remote post office.The address is:Suomen Metsätieteellinen Seura Viikinkaari 6 00790 Helsinki

    2. 1 copy➜ Rector of the campus

    3. 1 copy ➜ Dean of the Faculty

    4. 1 copy ➜ opponent (send one of the one sided copies, be carefull as the UEF normal envelopes only accept 500gr weigth, if it happens to be hevier you will have go to the UEF postal office in Aurora and they will find a proper envelope for it)

    5. 1 copy ➜ custos 

    6. 1 copy ➜ Administration Service Centre of the faculty (Taru Nylund)

    7. 1 copy ➜ other supervisors? 

    8. 1 copy➜ pre-examiner 1

    9. 1 copy ➜ pre-examiner 2

    10. save some copies for distribution at the public defence and for interest groups

        The aditional copies to the  University of Eastern Finland Library (9 copies) and to the  legal deposit (6 copies) are sent directly from Grano so you do not have to take care of this! 

15. Book the coffee in the building where you will defence, it is way better if you can do it in person / phone, and then send an email to confirm, for example I defended in futura and the contact person there is Pirritta and the email is: futura@fazerfoodco.fi. You can ordr coffee and cakfe from there (aprox 6.9€ per each) or just the coffee  (3€ each) and then order the cake somewherelse, the second option is the most economic, but you will need someone that will put the cake for you on the table. The 3€ include coffee, tea, cup, napkin, plate and spoon for cake and a thingy to serve tha cake. Also tell them to put a sing saying that is reserved for you just in case. 

16. Check the defense room before the defense date, verify that the room has a podium for you to read the lectura precursoria and talk with the janitor to confirm that he/she will set the room for you on that day, including water, chairs, lights, podium, etc. 



This is all in my mind for now, let me know if something is unclear! I am happy to help :)
