description: thoughts on changing your work pleace in COVID times
---

Last summer I took a calculated risk and I decided to move my family, home and work to a new country following an exciting offer. Planning was a struggle, dont really knowing until the last minute if we would be able to really move, living in a house full of half made moving boxes for over three months, and finding hard to say farewells to long lasting friends and collegues both for the personal side and logistically. I actually though that this would be the hardest part, but then I arrived to an empty office building and a work cooperation based on zoom meetings.

I am corridor person, meaning that I love to chat with collegues in the corridor when random chances appear, ask them about their weekend, their hobbies and sometimes work related stuff. This has helped me a lot to know better people and find common ground for future ativities and cooperations. Another activity that I enjoy a lot are coffee breaks, this daily reminder that you are not alone in the office, that there is other people doing similar things and going through simmilar stuff. I also learned a lot about logistics and strategies among collegues, about things that are happening at higher levels and oportunities that might come from that. 

When you are in a new place any small detail can save you lots of energy and time, just knowing where to find good bread, or transportation advices. I had the chance to spend couple of months in the office after 2 starting months in home office, everyday I was hopping to meet my new groupmates that I saw few times in a group zoom meetings, but it was very hard to know who they were in 3D, and when the masks become compulsory in the office that was a mess, eyes were not enough to link bodys with names. It also took me forever to know who was doing what, I felt socially incompetent and a bit embarrassed. 

My other challenge is that I started in this new job without having the home office experience from the first wave (I was on leave during that time), so then I came to an interaction based thorugh a platform that I did not know, the first group meeting where I was not introduced I could not hear the first words about me becuase I was not able to properly link the external speakers with my audio output! and then I just smiled I hoped that saying hello was enough for a reply...

This is not anybodys fault, I started working in a place that was not originally thought as remote work instiution but was forced into it few motnhs back. Everybody is trying their best to makes this work but it is not easy. I though a lot before all this about remote work, and naiviley thought that I understood its complexities and know how to survive but I was wrong. I think the academic part is totally ok, I can work and ask for help and find my way on my daily work but the cooperation, interaction and feeling that you are part of something bigger is way harder.
