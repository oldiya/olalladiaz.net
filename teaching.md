Do you want to be confident in academic presentations? Do you want to write a clear master thesis? Do you want to learn about science communication?  This course is for you!Upon successful completion of this course the students will be able to effectively communicate scientific knowledge when interacting with different audiences and using a variety of communication tools including traditional and ICT-based tools (e.g. blogs) and have solid grounding for thesis and academic paper writing, as well as for presenting scientific findings orally. The mode of study is based on lectures and interactive sessions on communication and presentation techniques (20 h); practicals – individual oral presentation, and group work on other communication methods (wiki, blog, or others).

Upon a successful completion of this course, the students are expected to be able to understand the principles of research methodology in forestry, taking into account the research issue and objective formulation as well as choosing an appropriate research approach, experimental set-up, and sampling technique. The students will be able to understand basic biometric and ecosystem modeling concepts, and to apply basic commands of R statistics to model and analyse the collected data. In addition, the students will be able to critically evaluate accuracy, error types, and reproducibility of research results. Finally, they will understand the basic concepts in Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing techniques, and use the basic GIS software to solve spatial problems, and perceive the potential for forestry-related research.
