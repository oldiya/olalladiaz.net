Do you want to be confident in academic presentations? Do you want to write a clear master thesis? Do you want to learn about science communication?  This course is for you!Upon successful completion of this course the students will be able to effectively communicate scientific knowledge when interacting with different audiences and using a variety of communication tools including traditional and ICT-based tools (e.g. blogs) and have solid grounding for thesis and academic paper writing, as well as for presenting scientific findings orally. The mode of study is based on lectures and interactive sessions on communication and presentation techniques (20 h); practicals – individual oral presentation, and group work on other communication methods (wiki, blog, or others).

Upon a successful completion of this course, the students are expected to be able to understand the principles of research methodology in forestry, taking into account the research issue and objective formulation as well as choosing an appropriate research approach, experimental set-up, and sampling technique. The students will be able to understand basic biometric and ecosystem modeling concepts, and to apply basic commands of R statistics to model and analyse the collected data. In addition, the students will be able to critically evaluate accuracy, error types, and reproducibility of research results. Finally, they will understand the basic concepts in Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing techniques, and use the basic GIS software to solve spatial problems, and perceive the potential for forestry-related research.

**How we produce energy from biomass? This course show you how!**

Upon a successful completion of this course, the students will have obtained knowledge and skills to understand the basis of biomass supply, energy production, engineering processes and technologies involved. The students will be familiar with the production aspects of various forms of biomass, including forest and agricultural residues, biomass plantations and peat. Supply, production, current use and utilization limitations, as well as the technologies related to energy production and conversion on a sustainable basis. The students will be able to handle basic research tools concerning biomass supply and use, as well as the use of the different technologies associated with the management, harvesting, transport, conversion and energy production.

## BIOENERGY MARKETS AND POLICIES

**Role:** Teacher assistant  
**Responsibilities:** Planning, teaching, material creation.  
**Teaching institution:** School of Forest Sciences, University of Eastern Finland

### Course description

**If you want to understand the forces and barriers for bioenergy markets development. This course is for you!**

Upon a successful completion of this course, the students have obtained knowledge and skills for analyzing the development of the driving forces and barriers of the expanding bioenergy markets at local, national and international level as well as for understanding the bioenergy-related policies and governance processes. The student must be able to handle basic tools of market analysis and trade, and have an understanding of the limitations and effects of the policy frameworks on the introduction and development of bioenergy. The student must understand the demands and needs of the consumers and the role of the European Union and the member states in the decision making and in the promotion of bioenergy.
