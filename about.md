I am interested in forests and their functioning, dynamics, and management. I find working with data and models to be a fun challenge, and I enjoy extracting value from data by examining problems from a small and holistic scale, as well as from different dimensions. This data-driven interest has allowed me to acquire solid statistical and programming skills, which I continue to enjoy using and learning about. I thrive in a multidisciplinary team environment, where I can collaborate and adapt to new challenges, such as working with different people, cultures, methods, perspectives, and ways of doing things.

I currently work in the [Forest Management Resources group at ETH Zurich (FORM)](https://form.ethz.ch), where I focus on improving forest risk management. I joined FORM in 2024.  In 2020, I joined ETH in the [Forest Ecology group at ETH (FE)](https://fe.ethz.ch/en/). My research at FE focuses on examining the structural uncertainty of forest dynamics models in relation to their ability to accurately represent natural disturbances. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Eastern Finland, where I evaluated optimal forest management practices that consider multiple ecosystem services and alternative management strategies. I also conducted analyses on how to incorporate the risk of natural disturbances into forest management and planning. I hold a PhD in Forest Sciences from the University of Eastern Finland and have had the privilege of working at various institutions worldwide, such as the US Forest Service in the USA, the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Sweden, IUFRO in Austria, and the Polytechnic University of Madrid in Spain.
